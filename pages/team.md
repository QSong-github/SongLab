## PI
Dr. Qianqian Song is a tenure-track Assistant Professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine since April 2021. She will be joining the University of Florida on Oct 1, 2023. Dr. Song’s research is focused on developing innovative computational methods and graph-based artificial intelligence algorithms to decipher disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic biomarkers. Her primary research interests are to advance precision medicine and personalized therapy through the data-driven informatics approach and the integration of multi-modality biomedical data. With specialized expertise in the large-scale biomedical data, spanning from the molecular level including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, to the cell-level with the cutting-edge single-cell and spatial omics data, and to the population level with the EHR and epidemiology data, Dr. Song has developed a series of tailored deep learning, machine learning, and statistical methods for data analysis, representation, and interpretation, to facilitate the understanding of human diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.
