## PI
Dr. Qianqian Song is a tenure-track Assistant Professor at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) since 2021. She will join the Univversity of Florida starting on Oct 1st. Dr. Song received a B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University. After the joint-PhD training at Beijing Normal University and Wake Forest University School of Medicine, she received her PhD degree in 2017, with an emphasis on bioinformatics and biomedical informatics.

Dr. Song’s research is focused on developing innovative computational methods and graph-based artificial intelligence algorithms to decipher disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic biomarkers. Her primary research interests are to advance precision medicine and personalized therapy through the data-driven informatics approach and the integration of multi-modality biomedical data. With specialized expertise in the large-scale biomedical data, spanning from the molecular level including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, to the cell-level with the cutting-edge single-cell and spatial omics data, and to the population level with the EHR and epidemiology data, Dr. Song has developed a series of tailored deep learning, machine learning, and statistical methods for data analysis, representation, and interpretation, to facilitate the understanding of human diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.
